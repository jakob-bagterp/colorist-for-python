# Colorist for Python ðŸŒˆ
## Introduction
Lightweight Python package that makes it easy and fast to print colored text in the terminal.

## How It Works
### Basics
Colorist is intended to be easy to use. Once [installed](./getting-started/installation.md), simply import the `colorist` module and start printing colored text:

```python linenums="1"
from colorist import BrightColor

print(f"I want {BrightColor.CYAN}cyan{BrightColor.OFF} color inside this paragraph")
```

How it appears in the terminal:

Or simply print a full line of colored text:

```python linenums="1"
from colorist import bright_yellow

bright_yellow("This is BRIGHT YELLOW!")
```

How it appears in the terminal:
