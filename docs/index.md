# Colorist for Python ðŸŒˆ
## What Is Colorist?
Lightweight Python package that makes it easy and fast to print colored text in the terminal.

<div class="color-cubes">
    <img src="assets/images/cubes/cube_bright.svg" alt="Color cube bright">
    <img src="assets/images/cubes/cube_dark.svg" alt="Color cube dark">
</div>

## How It Works
### Basic Usage
Colorist is intended to be easy to use. Imagine you want to print a mix of colors in the terminal:

<pre><code>% This is <span class="fg-red">RED</span>!</code></pre>

Once [installed](getting-started/installation.md), simply import the `colorist` module and start printing colored text with the `Color` class:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="3"
from colorist import Color

print(f"This is {Color.RED}RED{Color.OFF}!")
```

You can use the same method to [apply other colors to text](user-guide/standard-colors/text-foreground.md).

### Varied Color Palette
Or simply print a full line of colored text from a varied [palette of colors](user-guide/standard-colors/text-foreground.md#print-line-of-colored-text):

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="3-6"
from colorist import bright_magenta, bright_yellow, blue, green

cyan("This is BLUE!")
green("This is GREEN!")
bright_magenta("This is BRIGHT MAGENTA!")
bright_yellow("This is BRIGHT YELLOW!")
```

How it appears in the terminal:

<pre><code>% <span class="fg-blue">This is BLUE!</span>
% <span class="fg-green">This is GREEN!</span>
% <span class="fg-bright-magenta">This is BRIGHT MAGENTA!</span>
% <span class="fg-bright-yellow">This is BRIGHT YELLOW!</span></code></pre>

### Background Colors
It's also possible to apply [background colors](user-guide/standard-colors/background.md) to text:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="3"
from colorist import BgColor

print(f"This is {BgColor.RED}RED{BgColor.OFF}!")
```

How it appears in the terminal:

<pre><code>% This is <span class="bg-red text-contrast">RED</span>!</code></pre>

You can use the same method to [apply other background colors](user-guide/standard-colors/background.md) to text.
