# How to Use ANSI Escape Codes 🎨
Colorist uses ANSI escape codes to style text in the terminal. This section explains how ANSI escape codes work, and how to use them in your own code.

If you're new to ANSI escape codes, start with the [introduction](introduction.md) to learn the basics.

## ![Range of standard colors](../assets/images/colors/palette/rainbow_standard_96x16.png) &nbsp;&nbsp;Standard 16 Colors

Use the [standard palette of 16 colors](standard-16-colors.md) to add color to both text and background with ANSI escape codes.

## ![Range of RGB colors](../assets/images/colors/palette/rainbow_rgb_96x16.png) &nbsp;&nbsp;Extended 256 and RGB Colors

If your terminal supports an extended color space, you can use [256 extended colors](extended-256-colors.md) or [RGB colors](rgb-colors.md) to add more variety to your terminal output.

## ![Animated effects](../assets/images/colors/palette/rainbow_effects_96x16.gif) &nbsp;&nbsp;Effects

ANSI escape codes can also be used to apply [effects and styling](effects.md) to your terminal output.
