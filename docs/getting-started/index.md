# Get Started in 2 Easy Steps ðŸš€
Ready to try? Let's get started:

## 1. Install Colorist for Python Package
Assuming that [Python](https://www.python.org/) is already installed, execute this command in the terminal to install the Colorist package:

```shell title=""
pip install colorist
```

Find more details and options in the [installation guide](installation.md).

## 2. First Script
You're now ready to go:

```python linenums="1"
from colorist import Color, green

green("This is GREEN!")

print(f"Both {Color.RED}red{Color.OFF}...")
print(f"... and {Color.YELLOW}yellow{Color.OFF} are nice colors")
```

How it appears in the terminal:

<pre><code>% <span class="fg-green">This is GREEN!</span>
% Both <span class="fg-red">red</span>...
% ... and <span class="fg-yellow">yellow</span> are nice colors</code></pre>
