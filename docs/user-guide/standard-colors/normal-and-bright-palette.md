# Palette of Normal and Bright Colors
![Range of standard colors](../../assets/images/colors/palette/rainbow_standard_96x16.png)

Normal colors are slight dimmed and more easy on the eye than bright colors.

Bright colors have higher intensity that stand more out than normal colors.

!!! note "Color Definition May Vary from Terminal to Terminal"
    Be aware that text in standard red color isn't the same tone of red in all terminals, whether it's normal or bright. Sometimes with a little orange teint, sometimes a little darker. And the same goes for other standard colors.

    Find an overview of various terminals and their color palettes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit).

    Note that bright colors are [supported by many terminals](../materials/terminal-support.md), yet not all as bright colors aren't part of the standard set of ANSI colors.
